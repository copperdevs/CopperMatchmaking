# Copper Matchmaking

> Simple matchmaking server for creating two even player count teams for use in peer to peer

## Use Case

Copper Matchmaking was made for games with two teams, each with the same amount of players (5 for example), and for one
of those players to be the host in a peer to peer architecture. It also has ranks built in for pooling players.

## Installation

1. Install [RiptideNetworking](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide?tab=readme-ov-file). Instructions for installing riptide can be found [here](https://riptide.tomweiland.net/manual/overview/installation.html).
2. Install matchmaking
   - Unity package manager: `https://github.com/copperdevs/CopperMatchmaking.git?path=/unity`
   - [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CopperMatchmaking):  `dotnet add package CopperMatchmaking --version 1.2.0`
   
## Getting Started

### Server

1. Create ranks. The matchmaker creates a pool of players for each rank. Each connected client can only be matched
   into a lobby with players of the same rank.

    ```csharp
    public enum RankIds : byte
    {
        Unranked = 0,
        Bronze = 1,
        Silver = 2,
        Gold = 3,
        Platinum = 4,
        Diamond = 5,
        Master = 6,
        Chaos = 7
    }
    ```

2. Create the server. The constructor for `MatchmakerServer` has two parameters both with defaults.
    - `lobbySize`
        - `lobbySize` determines the amount of players in a lobby. This has to be an even number so both teams can have
          the same amount of players. The default is set to 10.
    - `maxClients`
        - `maxClients` determines the max amount of clients that can be connected to the matchmaker server. The default
          is set to 65534.

    ```csharp
    var server = new MatchmakerServer();
    ```

3. Once we have created the server and our ranks, we can register our ranks with the server. You can a max of register
   254 ranks. Once a rank has been registered it can not be removed. Calling `RegisterRanks` again will only add the
   ranks to the list again.
   ```csharp
    server.RegisterRanks(
        new Rank("Unranked", RankIds.Unranked),
        new Rank("Bronze", RankIds.Bronze),
        new Rank("Silver", RankIds.Silver),
        new Rank("Gold", RankIds.Gold),
        new Rank("Platinum", RankIds.Platinum),
        new Rank("Diamond", RankIds.Diamond),
        new Rank("Master", RankIds.Master),
        new Rank("Chaos", RankIds.Chaos));
    ```

4. Now you just have to consistently update the server. This can be done in a `while(true)` loop or in unitys built
   in `FixedUpdate` method.
    ```csharp
        while (true)
        {
            server.Update();
        }
    ```

    ```csharp
        private void FixedUpdate()
        {
            server.Update();
        }
    ```

5. Full example. Can also be found in the [CopperMatchmaking.Example.Server](CopperMatchmaking.Example.Server/Program.cs) project.
    ```csharp
        var server = new MatchmakerServer();
        server.RegisterRanks(
            new Rank("Unranked", RankIds.Unranked),
            new Rank("Bronze", RankIds.Bronze),
            new Rank("Silver", RankIds.Silver),
            new Rank("Gold", RankIds.Gold),
            new Rank("Platinum", RankIds.Platinum),
            new Rank("Diamond", RankIds.Diamond),
            new Rank("Master", RankIds.Master),
            new Rank("Chaos", RankIds.Chaos));
    
        while (true)
        {
            server.Update();
        }
    ```
    ```csharp
    public enum RankIds : byte
    {
        Unranked = 0,
        Bronze = 1,
        Silver = 2,
        Gold = 3,
        Platinum = 4,
        Diamond = 5,
        Master = 6,
        Chaos = 7
    }
    ```

### Client

1. The client is a lot easier to setup. The first step is to create a `ClientHandler` script that inherits from
   the `IClientHandler` interface. This example just shows blank information.

   ```csharp
   public class ClientHandler : IClientHandler
   {
       public ulong ClientRequestedToHost()
       {
           var serverJoinCode = 0;
           return serverJoinCode;
       }
   
       public void JoinServer(string serverJoinCode)
       {
       }

       public void Disconnected(DisconnectReason reason)
       {
       }
   }
   ```

2. Once the `ClientHandler` script is created we can create the client. The `MatchmakerClient` has four parameters with no defaults.
   - `ip`
      - `ip` is simple the target ip of the matchmaker server you wish to join. The player should not input this but the developer.. 
   - `clientHandler`
      - `clientHandler` is the script we created in the last step. 
   - `rankId`
      - `rankId` is the byte of the rank you created in the server getting started step one.
   - `playerId`
      - `playerId` is the id of the connecting player. Its intent when created was to use the players SteamId.

   ```csharp
   var client = new MatchmakerClient("127.0.0.1", new ClientHandler(), 0, 76561199083358154);
   ```
   
3. Update the client when needed. This should be done in `FixedUpdate` in unity
    ```csharp
    while (client.ShouldUpdate)
    {
        client.Update();
    }
    ```
    ```csharp
    public void FixedUpdate()
    {
        if (client.ShouldUpdate)
        {
            client.Update();
        }
    }
    ```
   
4. Full example. Can also be found in the [CopperMatchmaking.Example.Client](CopperMatchmaking.Example.Client/Program.cs) project.
    ```csharp
    var client = new MatchmakerClient("127.0.0.1", new ClientHandler(), 0, 76561199083358154);
    
    while (client.ShouldUpdate)
    {
        client.Update();
    }
    ```
