# Copper Matchmaking

> Simple matchmaking server for creating two even player count teams for use in peer to peer

## Use Case

Copper Matchmaking was made for games with two teams, each with the same amount of players (5 for example), and for one
of those players to be the host in a peer to peer architecture. It also has ranks built in for pooling players.
